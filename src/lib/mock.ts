        'Front‑End – Situation: Multiple vendor‑specific UI kits extended feature rollout by ~30 %. Task: Standardize UI across 7–10 Nuxt apps. Action: Architected “Dorado” Vue Lerna monorepo, integrated Bootstrap 5 and custom CSS utilities. Result: Reduced UI‑development time by 35 % and regressions by 25 %.',
        'Back‑End – Situation: Legacy REST endpoints lacked consistency and performance. Task: Design, implement, and document new API surfaces. Action: Created 20+ Django‑REST endpoints, refactored models with serializer validation, added caching. Result: API latency dropped 18 % and error rate fell below 0.1 %.',
        'Campaign & Marketing Infrastructure – Situation: PDP pages lacked dynamic promotion banners, hurting conversion. Task: Build a flexible banner system. Action: Developed a banner framework with variant logic and mobile‑first optimization. Result: Lifted average CPC by 12 % and drove $3.2 k incremental sales per month.',
        'Analytics & Data Intelligence – Situation: GA tracking captured 78 % of key ecommerce events, leading to data loss. Task: Migrate to GA4 and implement full event schema. Action: Established content groups, ecommerce data layers, and server‑side tagging. Result: Increased reliable event capture from 78 % to 99 % and eliminated data‑loss incidents by 100 %.',
